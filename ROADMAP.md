---

## Implementation Pass - 2026-05-XX AI Wallpaper Generation (Phase 3.1)

- [x] **Version**: Bumped to v6.14.0 / versionCode 94 (skipping 6.13.0 which was committed but never landed in build.gradle.kts).
- [x] **Phase 3.1 AI Wallpaper Generation**: Full implementation shipped.
  - `StabilityAiApi` — Retrofit interface for `POST v2beta/stable-image/generate/core` (multipart binary response).
  - `AiWallpaperRepository` — generates 9:16 PNG, atomic write to `filesDir/ai_wallpapers/`, `pruneOldFiles(50)` storage cap.
  - `AiStyle` enum — PHOTOGRAPHIC, ANIME, DIGITAL_ART, CINEMATIC, FANTASY, NEON_PUNK, PIXEL_ART, NONE with display labels and API preset strings.
  - `AiWallpaperViewModel` — Hilt ViewModel; `stabilityAiKey` StateFlow from DataStore; full generate/apply/save flow.
  - `AiWallpaperScreen` — GlassCard header with animated API key field (password toggle + save), prompt OutlinedTextField (500-char cap), style FilterChip row, generate button with shimmer placeholder during generation, result image with Save to Favorites + Set Wallpaper (HOME/LOCK/BOTH dropdown).
  - Entry point: "AI" FilledTonalButton with AutoAwesome icon in WallpapersScreen chip row; routes to `Screen.AiWallpaper`.
  - `STABILITY_AI_KEY` BuildConfig field; `PreferencesManager.stabilityAiKey` / `setStabilityKey()` for DataStore persistence.
  - `ContentSource.AI_GENERATED` added to enum; `sourceDisplayName()` exhaustive when branch updated.
- [x] Confirmed Phase 2.4 "Change your style" Settings entry is already implemented (`SettingsScreen.kt` ~line 375).
- [x] Confirmed Phase 5.3 VFX Particle Overlays already implemented (`VfxParticleRenderer.kt`).

---

## Implementation Pass - 2026-04-25 Product Polish

- [x] Confirmed 2.4 gap is already resolved: Settings > Wallpapers > "Style preferences" (`SettingsScreen.kt` line 375) opens a `FilterChip` dialog backed by `prefs.setUserStyles()` — re-entry from Settings was already wired in a prior session and is fully functional.
- [x] Sounds COMMUNITY tab empty state: added "Upload a sound" `FilledTonalButton` to the empty state so users on an empty COMMUNITY tab see a direct CTA instead of dead-end text.
- [x] Downloads broken-file badge: `DownloadsScreen` now async-checks file existence via `LaunchedEffect(displayList)` on a background dispatcher. `DownloadHistoryCard` receives a `broken` flag and renders a `Warning` icon in error-red with a "File missing" label instead of silently failing on tap.
- [ ] Remaining 2.5 gap: wallpaper Discover still doesn't bias non-Wallhaven sources (Pexels/Pixabay) by style; query is Wallhaven-only.

---

## Implementation Pass - 2026-04-27 Seasonal Content & Personalization

- [x] Marked Phase 1 items 1.2 (Freesound v2), 1.3 (SoundCloud CC), 1.4 (Drop IA) as done — all were already implemented in prior sessions but left unchecked.
- [x] Marked Phase 2 items 2.3 (QuickApplySheet), 2.6 (Sound Detail redesign) as done — fully implemented but unchecked.
- [x] Implemented 2.5 Seasonal Content: `SeasonalContentManager` resolves the active seasonal theme from the current date (Holiday Dec, Halloween Oct 15–31, New Year Jan 1–3, Valentine Feb 10–14, Summer Jun 21–Sep 1). Wired into Sounds tab (seasonal SoundCollectionSpec prepended to carousel) and Wallpapers Discover (seasonal banner card in the staggered grid).
- [x] Completed 2.4 Onboarding Personalization feed wiring: `WallpaperRepository.getDiscover()` now accepts `userStyles` and adds a style-biased Wallhaven search alongside the toplist when the user has onboarding preferences set.
- [x] Focused unit test: `SeasonalContentManagerTest` — covers all five season windows, off-season null return, and boundary dates.
- [x] Remaining 2.4 gap resolved: see Implementation Pass - 2026-04-25 above.

---

## Implementation Pass - 2026-04-25 Diagnostics Follow-Up

- [x] Completed T-6 follow-up from the v6.12.0 continuation brief: SourceMetrics now covers the remaining core wallpaper sources (Discover aggregate, Reddit, Bing, Pixabay, Pexels, Wallhaven variants) and sound sources (Openverse fallback, Freesound v2, YouTube, SoundCloud, Audius, ccMixter).
- [x] Diagnostics polish: Settings > Diagnostics now observes live in-session source updates, keeps Reset in-place, and shows summary chips plus per-source health rows instead of a static one-time snapshot.
- [x] Test coverage: SourceMetrics now has focused tests for the reusable measurement wrapper and live update tick.
- [ ] Remaining candidate: decide whether source diagnostics should add persisted export/report sharing. Keep it deferred until user reports need post-session debugging.
- [ ] Still deferred: T-8 plugin/source ABI, T-9 GLWallpaperService migration, and T-10 Firebase RTDB to Firestore migration remain large follow-ups requiring separate scoping.

## Implementation Pass - 2026-04-25 Create From Music

- [x] Completed the P0 1.5 app-level entry: Sounds > Create from music now opens the system audio picker and routes the selected local file straight into SoundEditorScreen's waveform loader.
- [x] Product polish: the editor opens in Create Sound mode for local files, avoids stale selected remote sounds, and skips redundant local URI reloads after recomposition/configuration changes.
- [x] Ringtone trim polish: long clips now default to a 30s selection, and the editor surfaces 8-30s guidance without blocking notification/alarm use cases.
- [x] Emulator smoke: generated local WAV opens in Create Sound mode with waveform, trim timing, guidance, fade controls, and ringtone/notification/alarm actions visible.
- [ ] Remaining candidate: repeat create-from-music QA through the system picker on a physical device with real user music files.

## Implementation Pass - 2026-04-26 Sounds Tab Chrome

- [x] Completed the P0 2.1 header simplification slice: the Sounds tab now exposes Ringtones, Notifications, and Alarms as visible primary chips instead of hiding the core modes behind a source dropdown.
- [x] Product polish: YouTube, Community, and active Search are kept in a compact secondary menu; quality bias remains in the existing bottom sheet behind the search-row Refine button.
- [x] Follow-up completed in the Sound Discovery Carousel pass: collection discovery was restored as compact in-feed cards.

## Implementation Pass - 2026-04-26 Sound Discovery Carousel

- [x] Completed the remaining 2.1 discovery slice: Sounds now shows tab-aware collection cards for Ringtones, Notifications, and Alarms inside the feed, routing each card into focused search.
- [x] Product polish: long-press quick apply now keeps the sheet open while applying, shows disabled/busy state in-place, and surfaces the missing system-settings permission with a direct Grant action.
- [x] Comparable-product research applied: Paperize-style organized collections, Muzei-style source browsing clarity, and ringtone-maker preview/apply workflow emphasis were used as fit checks without copying external code.
- [x] Test coverage: SoundQualityTest now covers collection visibility and nonblank distinct discovery queries.
- [x] Follow-up completed in the Instant Sound Preview pass: first-visible previews now prebuffer through the playback cache.

## Implementation Pass - 2026-04-26 Instant Sound Preview

- [x] Completed the 2.2 cache slice: first-visible preview URLs are prebuffered into a shared Media3 SimpleCache, and AudioPlaybackService plays through the same cache.
- [x] Product polish: sound cards now show a compact Ready badge once the preview cache is warm, making playback state clearer before the user taps.
- [x] YouTube continuity: existing search-time preview URL resolution now feeds the same first-visible prebuffer window once URLs are available.
- [x] Test coverage: SoundsViewModelTest verifies only the first five preview URLs are prebuffered and exposed as ready.
- [ ] Remaining candidate: true local bundled audio assets still belong to Phase 1.1; current Aura Picks are URL-backed and now warmed by the cache.

## Phase 1 — Content Foundation

*Problem: Aura is a search engine pretending to be a curated library. Fix the content first.*

### 1.1 Ship Bundled Content ("Aura Collection")
- Bundle 200-500 high-quality CC0/public domain sounds in the APK (or download-on-first-launch asset pack)
  - 100+ ringtones (8-30s): melodic, minimal, electronic, marimba, retro
  - 100+ notification sounds (1-5s): chimes, pings, dings, clicks, pops
  - 100+ alarm sounds (10-40s): gentle wake, buzzer, nature, musical
  - 50+ bonus sound effects
- Source from Freesound.org's top-rated CC0 sounds in bulk (batch download, curate, normalize volume)
- Store in Room DB as `ContentSource.LOCAL_BUNDLED`, always available offline
- "Aura Originals" badge on these sounds
- First-run experience shows these immediately — no loading, no API calls, instant content

### 1.2 Freesound API v2 Direct Integration
- [x] `FreesoundV2Api` Retrofit interface registered and wired (`FreesoundV2Repository`)
- [x] Quality signals: `avg_rating`, `num_downloads`, `sort=rating_desc`
- [x] Preview URLs: `preview-hq-mp3` / `preview-lq-mp3`; duration server-side via Solr `filter`
- [x] Source badge: "FS" (blue)

### 1.3 SoundCloud CC-Licensed Tracks
- [x] `SoundCloudApi` + `SoundCloudRepository` wired and active
- [x] Quality signals: `playback_count`, `likes_count`, `reposts_count`; source badge "SC" (orange)

### 1.4 Drop Internet Archive
- [x] `SoundRepository` (IA), `InternetArchiveApi`, `IAAudioCacheDao` removed
- [x] DB migration v6→v7 drops `ia_audio_cache`; `ContentSource.INTERNET_ARCHIVE` kept for legacy favorites compat

### 1.5 Ringtone Maker from Device Music
- [x] "Create from Music" button on Sounds tab
- [x] File picker: `ActivityResultContracts.GetContent("audio/*")`
- [x] Load into SoundEditorScreen with waveform
- [x] Add ringtone-specific 8-30s trim guidance/defaults; existing editor already supports manual trim and fade controls
- [x] One-tap set as ringtone/notification/alarm
- This alone is the #1 feature on ringtone apps (Ringtone Maker has 100M+ downloads)

---

## Phase 2 — UX Overhaul

*Problem: Engineer's app, not user's app. Too many controls, not enough delight.*

### 2.1 Simplify the Sounds Tab
- [x] Remove: duration filter chips, sort chips, genre chips, mood chips from the persistent header
- [x] New layout: Search bar → Tab row (Ringtones/Notifications/Alarms) → Content
- [x] Move quality refinement into the existing bottom sheet behind the search-row Refine button; no persistent genre/mood/sort rows remain
- [x] Collections carousel stays — it now lives in feed content as tab-aware discovery cards, not persistent chrome
- Result: 2 rows of chrome instead of 4, content starts at 20% of screen instead of 45%

### 2.2 Instant Sound Preview
- [x] Pre-buffer the first 5 visible sounds' preview URLs on load
- [x] For YouTube sounds: resolve preview URL during search, not on tap
- [x] Tap play uses the same prebuffer cache and exposes a Ready state before playback
- [x] For Freesound v2: previews are direct URLs, no resolution needed
- [ ] For bundled content: local file, instant; still tied to Phase 1.1 bundled asset expansion

### 2.3 One-Tap Apply Flow
- [x] Long-press → `QuickApplySheet` with: Set as Ringtone / Notification / Alarm / Download
- [x] Regular tap → detail screen; `QuickApplyRow` with permission warning, loading indicator, source badge
- [x] Sheet stays open while applying; shows disabled/busy state in-place

### 2.4 Onboarding Personalization
- [x] "What's your style?" picker on onboarding page 3 (10 style cards: minimal, amoled, nature, space, anime, abstract, neon, city, gradient, dark)
- [x] Stored in DataStore (`userStyles`); read by `WallpapersViewModel.loadUserStyles()`
- [x] Wallpaper ranking in `WallpaperFeedQuality.wallpaperQualityScore()` boosts items matching user style tags
- [x] Discover feed sends style-biased Wallhaven query in addition to toplist when styles are set
- [x] "Change your style" entry point in Settings already implemented (`SettingsScreen.kt` ~line 375)

### 2.5 Seasonal/Contextual Content
- [x] `SeasonalContentManager` created — checks current date for Dec (Holiday), Oct 15–31 (Halloween), Jan 1–3 (New Year), Feb 10–14 (Valentine), Jun 21–Sep 1 (Summer)
- [x] Sounds tab: seasonal `SoundCollectionSpec` prepended to the carousel when in-season
- [x] Wallpapers tab: seasonal banner card in Discover grid (routes to themed wallpaper search)
- [x] `SeasonalContentManagerTest` covers all season boundaries

### 2.6 Sound Detail Screen Redesign
- [x] Top: waveform (full-width, 80dp) with integrated play/pause overlay
- [x] Below: sound name + source/duration/uploader one-line row + badges + tags
- [x] Primary: 3 large buttons side-by-side (Ringtone / Notification / Alarm)
- [x] Secondary icon row: Trim, Contact, Save, Share
- [x] "More Like This" horizontal scroll at bottom

---

## Phase 3 — AI & Generation

*Problem: All content is sourced externally. Let users create their own.*

### 3.1 AI Wallpaper Generation
- [x] Stability AI API (free tier: 25 credits/month, ~25 generations)
  - `POST https://api.stability.ai/v2beta/stable-image/generate/core` — multipart form, binary PNG response
- [x] UI: Text prompt (500 char) + style FilterChip row (Photo/Anime/Digital Art/Cinematic/Fantasy/Neon/Pixel/None)
- [x] Generate button -> shimmer loading -> result preview -> set as wallpaper (HOME/LOCK/BOTH)
- [x] Save to Favorites with `ContentSource.AI_GENERATED`
- [x] API key persisted in DataStore; in-screen key field with animated reveal + save
- [x] Storage capped at 50 generated images (`pruneOldFiles`)
- [x] Entry point: "AI" chip in WallpapersScreen header row
- **This is the single biggest differentiator vs every other open-source wallpaper app**

### 3.2 AI Sound Generation (Stretch)
- Meta's AudioCraft / MusicGen (open-source, can run on-device for short clips)
- Or: Replicate API with MusicGen model (~$0.002/generation)
- "Describe your ringtone" → generates 10-20s audio clip
- Style options: Melodic, Electronic, Ambient, Retro 8-bit
- Lower priority than wallpaper generation but very differentiating

### 3.3 Parallax/Depth Wallpapers
- [x] ML Kit's depth estimation (on-device, free) on any static wallpaper
- [x] Split into foreground/background layers
- [x] Gyroscope-reactive parallax movement in `WallpaperService`
- [x] Toggle in wallpaper detail: "Enable Parallax" (via ApplyOptionsSheet)
- [x] Also works with AI-generated wallpapers
- Already implemented in `ParallaxWallpaperService.kt`, fully functional, entry point in detail screen bottom sheet

---

## Phase 4 — Community & Social

*Problem: Content library doesn't grow. Users consume but don't contribute.*

### 4.1 User-Generated Sound Uploads
- Record from microphone or pick from device
- Upload to Firebase Storage, metadata to Firebase RTDB
- Required fields: name, category (ringtone/notification/alarm), tags

---

## Phase 6 — Smart Features

### 6.1 Material You Color Preview
- [x] Extract Monet tonal palettes from wallpaper using Palette API (ColorExtractor.kt, already implemented)
- [x] Show 5 tonal palette strips (Dominant, Vibrant, Muted, Accent, Light) with hex values
- [x] Display on wallpaper detail screen below the existing Palette section
- [x] "Your theme colors" section with Material You swatches (rounded rectangles, labeled, hex values)
- [x] LaunchedEffect calls `viewModel.extractColors()` when wallpaper loads; shows shimmer while extracting
- Implementation complete: WallpaperDetailScreen integrates `colorPalette` StateFlow collection, renders scrollable swatch row with tonal colors

### 6.2 Dark/Light Mode Auto-Switch
- Two wallpaper slots: "Light mode wallpaper" + "Dark mode wallpaper"
- `UiModeManager` listener for system theme changes
- Auto-applies correct wallpaper when user toggles system dark mode

- [x] Prefs bridge: SettingsViewModel writes both DataStore (for UI) and SharedPrefs (for service read)
- [x] Tint applied on bitmap draw using ColorMatrixColorFilter paint, intensity scaled offsets
- Implementation complete: SolarCalculator.kt handles time-zone-aware sunrise/sunset; WeatherWallpaperService loads and applies tints; SettingsScreen surfaces intensity slider when tint is enabled

### 6.5 Smart Crop with Object Detection
- ML Kit Object Detection (free, on-device)
- When cropping landscape to portrait, detect primary subject
- Auto-position crop rectangle to center on the subject
- Apply to both wallpaper and video crop screens

---

## Phase 7 — Polish & Infrastructure

### 7.1 Unified Audio Service

- **google/oboe/samples/LiveEffect/src/main/cpp/LiveEffect.cpp** — https://github.com/google/oboe/blob/main/samples/LiveEffect/src/main/cpp/LiveEffect.cpp — low-latency Oboe audio callback, useful if Aura upgrades the sound preview loop from ExoPlayer single-instance to Oboe for ringtone A/B previews.
- **airbnb/lottie-android/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieAnimationView.java** — https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android — animated-wallpaper-template path via `LottieDrawable.draw(Canvas)` into a `WallpaperService.Engine` surface. Lets Aura ship "live wallpaper templates" without bundling per-template APKs.

### Known Pitfalls from Similar Projects
- **`SurfaceView` RGB_565 vs `WallpaperService` RGBX_8888 default pixel format** — Learn OpenGL ES article — switching `GLSurfaceView` into a live wallpaper without calling `setEGLConfigChooser(8,8,8,0,0,0)` produces banding. https://www.learnopengles.com/how-to-use-opengl-es-2-in-an-android-live-wallpaper/
- **ML Kit Selfie Segmenter adds ~4.5MB but `libxeno_native.so` can spike +50MB** — googlesamples/mlkit#386 — check APK size post-dependency bump. https://github.com/googlesamples/mlkit/issues/386
- **Selfie segmenter <10 fps on low-end at 360p** — googlesamples/mlkit#436 — always pre-downsample to 256×256 in STREAM_MODE before feeding `InputImage.fromBitmap`. https://github.com/googlesamples/mlkit/issues/436
- **ML Kit face-detector memory-leak class of bug** — googlesamples/mlkit#137 — if a new frame lands while detector is running, drop it; do not queue. Aura already does this for wallpapers but re-verify for sound waveforms. https://github.com/googlesamples/mlkit/issues/137
- **NewPipe-extractor API keeps breaking on YouTube backend changes** — NewPipe maintainers ship patches monthly; Aura must track the extractor version (not the app) and bump on every release. https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor
- **Freesound v2 API token-bucket rate limiter — 60 req/min per IP** — Aura must back off with `Retry-After` handling; currently silent. https://freesound.org/docs/api/overview.html#rate-limiting
- **FFmpeg `libffmpeg.so` loaded via reflection from yt-dlp library** — fragile; on yt-dlp library upgrade the JNI symbol path can shift. Pin yt-dlp version + add a startup self-test that runs `ffmpeg -version` and disables video wallpapers if it fails.
- **Muzei plugin IPC requires API-versioning — breaking changes are silent** — Muzei 1.x → 2.x broke every third-party source. If Aura ships a plugin ABI, version it from day one. https://github.com/muzei/muzei/wiki/Changelog
- **Palette API colors unreliable on cartoon/solid-color images** — single dominant color from Palette can read as dark gray. Use `getDominantSwatch()` → fall back to `getVibrantSwatch()` → `getMutedSwatch()` before using for Material You accent. https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/palette/graphics/Palette
- **Firebase Realtime Database quota on free tier (100 concurrent, 10GB/mo transfer)** — VoteRepository already uses ConcurrentHashMap, but a viral wallpaper can saturate quota. Shard community votes by hash or migrate to Firestore for better quota model.

### Library Integration Checklist
- **GLWallpaperService (OpenGL live wallpapers)** — no Maven coords; vendor `GLWallpaperService.java` + `GLEngine` + `RenderThread` into `com.freevibe.wallpaper.gl/`. Entry: `class ParallaxGlService : GLWallpaperService() { override onCreateEngine() = GLEngine().also { it.setEGLContextClientVersion(2); it.setRenderer(ParallaxRenderer()) } }`. Gotcha: `WallpaperService.Engine.onVisibilityChanged(false)` must pause the GLSurfaceView's render thread or battery drain doubles.
- **NewPipeExtractor (YouTube search + stream resolve)** — `com.github.TeamNewPipe:NewPipeExtractor:0.24.x` (pin to exact version, breaking changes every ~6 weeks). Entry: `NewPipe.init(DownloaderImpl.init(null)); val info = StreamInfo.getInfo(url)`. Gotcha: `DownloaderImpl` ships a buggy stream leak — use `InputStream.use { }` explicitly and wrap `BufferedReader` in `use` (Aura already fixed this in v5.8 but re-verify on every upstream bump).
- **ML Kit Selfie Segmentation** — `com.google.mlkit:segmentation-selfie:16.0.0-beta6` — entry: `Segmentation.getClient(SelfieSegmenterOptions.Builder().setDetectorMode(STREAM_MODE).enableRawSizeMask().build())`. Gotcha: `Segmenter.close()` must be called on `WallpaperService.Engine.onDestroy()` and the outstanding `Task` must complete or be observed; dropping it leaks ~7MB per engine lifecycle.


## Implementation Deep Dive (Round 3)

### Reference Implementations to Study
- **Freesound APIv2 docs** — https://freesound.org/docs/api/resources_apiv2.html — canonical endpoint reference; `GET /apiv2/search/text/` with `filter=license:"Creative Commons 0" duration:[1.0 TO 30.0]` and `sort=rating_desc` is the right shape for each content category
- **MTG/freesound-python** — https://github.com/MTG/freesound-python — official Freesound reference client (Python); port the field masks, auth header (`Authorization: Token <key>`), and pagination cursor to the Kotlin/Retrofit layer
- **AlynxZhou/alynx-live-wallpaper** — https://github.com/AlynxZhou/alynx-live-wallpaper — the cleanest ExoPlayer + OpenGL ES center-crop video wallpaper reference; adopt its `GLWallpaperService` engine wholesale for video wallpaper support
- **cyunrei/Video-Live-Wallpaper** — https://github.com/cyunrei/Video-Live-Wallpaper — minimal-memory variant, good for low-end device path
- **google/ExoPlayer / androidx.media3** — https://github.com/androidx/media — current home of Media3; the roadmap's "preview player" should track media3 1.9.x like NovaCut
- **Android Ringtone API reference** — https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/RingtoneManager — `RingtoneManager.setActualDefaultRingtoneUri` + `MediaStore.Audio.Media.IS_RINGTONE` metadata; the only approved path to set system ringtone on API 26+
- **opensource.creativecommons.org Freesound intro** — https://opensource.creativecommons.org/blog/entries/freesound-intro/ — license compliance walkthrough, CC0 redistribution rules for the bundled "Aura Collection"
- **Openverse** — https://api.openverse.engineering — the source the roadmap calls out as losing quality signals; keep as secondary fallback, not primary

### Known Pitfalls from Similar Projects
- **Freesound `/apiv1/search/text/` deprecated Nov 2025** — https://freesound.org/docs/api/resources_apiv2.html — v1 endpoints redirect but will eventually 410; hard-code v2 paths from day one
- **API token vs OAuth2** — https://freesound.org/help/developers/ — download of full (non-preview) audio requires OAuth2, not the simple API token; the token only gets you metadata + 128kbps previews
- **Previews are MP3, not original** — Freesound API ref — `previews.preview-hq-mp3` is re-encoded and may not match the original's loudness; normalize bundled originals separately
- **MediaStore ringtone write permission** — https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/media — on Android 11+ `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` no longer works; must use `MediaStore.createPendingInsert` + `Ringtone` URI flip — many OSS apps still fail silently here
- **ExoPlayer holds audio focus by default** — AlynxZhou README above — must call `.setAudioAttributes(null, false)` or live wallpaper steals audio from music apps
- **H.264 wallpaper burns battery** — XDA analysis linked above — prefer MPEG-4/DivX re-encode or cap 480p@20fps; H.265 is usually worse for wallpaper due to decode overhead not being offset by bitrate savings
- **`onVisibilityChanged(false)` must pause** — https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2010/02/live-wallpapers.html — apps that don't release the decoder on invisibility drain battery even when the user is in another app
- **CC0 does not protect against DMCA re-uploads** — community cautionary threads — verify each bundled file's uploader-claimed CC0 against Freesound's moderation flag before shipping; keep a sha256 manifest for retroactive removal

### Library Integration Checklist
- **Retrofit 2.11 + OkHttp 4.12** — `@GET("apiv2/search/text/") fun search(@Query("query") q: String, @Query("filter") f: String, @Query("fields") fs: String, @Query("page_size") ps: Int): Response<SearchResponse>`; header interceptor adds `Authorization: Token ${BuildConfig.FREESOUND_TOKEN}`; gotcha: `filter` must be URL-encoded incl. the quotes around license names
- **kotlinx.serialization 1.7** — for `SearchResponse` models; gotcha: Freesound fields can be null in unexpected places (`avg_rating=0` for unrated) — mark all rating fields nullable
- **androidx.media3 1.9.2** (ExoPlayer) — match NovaCut's pin; `ExoPlayer.Builder(context).setAudioAttributes(AudioAttributes.DEFAULT, false).build()`; gotcha: handle `Player.STATE_ENDED` by re-seeking to 0 for looping wallpapers — `setRepeatMode(REPEAT_MODE_ONE)` is cheaper than manual seek
- **OpenGL ES 2.0 renderer** for video wallpaper — port from alynx-live-wallpaper; shader program with `SurfaceTexture` → fragment shader `samplerExternalOES`; gotcha: Samsung devices re-create the GL context when wallpaper picker previews, handle `onSurfaceCreated` idempotently
- **androidx.work 2.10** — for "Aura Originals" asset-pack download on first launch; `OneTimeWorkRequest` with network constraint; gotcha: large blob downloads need `setExpedited(OUT_OF_QUOTA_POLICY.RUN_AS_NON_EXPEDITED_WORK_REQUEST)`
- **androidx.datastore-preferences 1.1** — for token + user prefs; do NOT store Freesound OAuth refresh token in SharedPreferences (plaintext); use EncryptedSharedPreferences with MasterKey
- **coil 2.7** (not Glide) — for artwork thumbnails in the browser grid; already AMOLED-friendly, matches FreeVibe/Aura's existing Compose stack
- **Room 2.7** — `ContentSource.LOCAL_BUNDLED` enum value in the existing sound DB; schema migration needs an `is_bundled` flag + `sha256` column for the retroactive-removal path
- **Room FTS4 virtual table** — for tag search; gotcha: FTS doesn't like the `-` in `Creative-Commons-0`; tokenize on spaces and strip punctuation in the insert trigger
